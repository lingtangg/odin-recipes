        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Today we have two really really exciting things to talk about. Thing #1: Taiwanese Beef Noodle Soup, a recipe that has long weighed on our minds. Thing #2: Instant Pot and the start of our journey with this beloved and much-hyped kitchen sensation.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3 pounds beef shank</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons oil</li>
            <li>etc.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Method</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Boil enough water in a pot to boil all of your beef. Once the water is boiling, add the beef. Let it come back up to a boil, and boil for 1 minute. Strain in a colander and rinse thoroughly with fresh water to remove any impurities.</li>
            <li>Next, in your instant pot, turn on the saute setting. Add the oil, crushed ginger, garlic, scallions, and onions in that order. Stir to lightly caramelize. Let the onion turn translucent. Add the tomato and dried chilies.</li>
